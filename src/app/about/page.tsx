            <p>
              LawBridge was founded in 2023 with a simple yet powerful idea: to make legal services more accessible and understandable for everyone. Our founders, experienced legal professionals and tech innovators, recognized the challenges many people face when dealing with legal issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              They envisioned a platform that would not only connect clients with the right legal experts but also provide educational resources to empower individuals with legal knowledge. This vision gave birth to LawBridge, a comprehensive legal service platform that combines technology with human expertise.
